# Finger-Counter-without-using-HandTrackingModule
This project is a real-time hand and finger counter implemented using OpenCV in Python. The program captures video from a webcam or a video file, processes each frame to detect hand contours, and counts the number of fingers raised. The results are displayed on the video feed in real-time.
